function [waypts] = zigzag
% ZIGZAG generates waypoints to move the robot in a zigzag pattern

% The zigzag pattern should alternate moving the robot is the positive x
% and y directions, starting with x.  The trajectory should have 10 steps
% (a step consists of moving in x then y) and the step size (motion in x or
% y) should be 0.2m.  The robot should start at the origin.
